    "It is so called as it attempts to find the parameter values that are most likely to have produced the observed dataâ€”maximises the likelihood function.\n",

    "This is given as $ p(x_1|\\theta) \\times p(x_2|\\theta) ... \\times p(x_n|\\theta) = p(x_1,x_2,...,x_n|\\theta)$ which in turn decomposes to  $\\prod_{i=1}^n p(x_i | \\theta)$\n",

    "We now need to find theta. Maximum likelihood seeks the find value of theta that maximizes the probability of our joint probability function $p(x_1,x_2,...,x_n|\\theta)$. The problem can in fact be rephrased as finding the value of $\\theta$ that most likely given the observed data, which can be expressed mathematically as $L = (\\theta | x_1,x_2,...,x_n)$.\n",
